    "I went into Extermination with some 'low' expectations/worries, the FAQ mentioning no plans for mod support or player-hosted servers, the lack of bots, no mention of how difficulty would scale, etc.",
    "But after taking a plunge and biting the bullet, I can safely put aside those worries - at least for now.",
    "I've put twelve hours into the game, on one medium-sized map, with three objectives at best the entire game and I *love* it, the game absolutely nails the vibes of the original film and its many sequels that exist in some form (the anime movies are pretty good!)",
    "Moving on with the review, combat's fast, frantic, chaotic and blinding (in a good way!)",
    "The final objective of the two current gamemodes is absolutely exhilarating having to manage your defences against a tidal wave of Arachnid's that rapidly take down the base you spent a match (in Arc mode at least) or the last five minutes building, it genuinely makes you, as the player, feel as if you're a part of the movie especially when the currently fantastic fanbase start quoting lines from the IP or getting into the role of a Mobile Infantry soldier, its great.",
    "Combat's fun, weapons feel pretty good even with their pretty limited variety now, map design's fun, objectives are decent enough to give you goals - but man...",
    "Seeing the huge hordes you can get, piled with plasma barrages from the plasma bugs, or explosives from Grenade Launching medics or Hunters zipping about on jetpacks with their Rockets - there's nothing else like it in the current market save for EDF but that's not exactly immersive (I also recommend you to check out that franchise btw.)",
    "My only real complaints are just the weapon variety and the classes themselves, hopefully the upcoming roadmap (June 1st at the time of writing.) will give us some heads up on what's going to be added or changed with them - for example, Hunter and Operator have the exact same weaponry, but worse abilities (Hunter just gets a jetpack.) meanwhile Operator can provide ammo, healing, thermal packs, carry two cannisters at max speed - so why bother playing the Hunter?",
    "Bastion's ok, the LMG's pretty useful when you pair it with the class' ability, but past that, it's just Morita and the LMG but hey, early days and all.",
    "For now - I'd say the game's definitely worth purchasing and checking out, even if you're completely new to the IP.",
    "It's fun, frantic and I do want to know more (haha) on what's coming in the future with this game.",
    "Jokes aside, I'm excited to see how this game progresses, major props to Offworld for making such a fun game."
